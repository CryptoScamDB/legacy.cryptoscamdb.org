                    <div class="item"><b>Use cold storage</b> - Buy a <a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/6e75?path=/products/">Ledger Nano S</a> or a <a href="https://shop.trezor.io?a=luit.hollander@gmail.com">Trezor</a></div>
                    <div class="item"><b>Bookmark your crypto sites</b> - Use those bookmarks and only those.</div>
                    <div class="item"><b>Only send funds to trusted addresses</b> - Double-check what address you're sending ETH to. Look up the address at <a href="https://etherscan.io">etherscan.io</a> and check if there are bad reviews</div>
                    <div class="item"><b>Never trust any discord/slack/telegram/reddit message</b> - Don't ever fall for messages that say you can get free ETH or that a hack has occurred.</div>
                </div>
                MyCrypto has written a great guide on <a href="https://support.mycrypto.com/security/securing-your-ethereum.html">protecting yourself and your funds</a>.
                <h2>How can I join the fight?</h2>

                    <div class="item">Report scams to us <a href="../report">here</a></div>

                </div>
                <h2>Can I use the data from this project?</h2>
                Yes, you can either <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CryptoScamDB/blacklist/master/data/urls.yaml" target="_blank">download the raw data files from Github</a> or take a look at our <a href="/api">API</a>.
                <h2>Are the reports open source? Where do they go?</h2>
                <p>All reports end up in a private Slack to protect people's privacy. The reports can be read by all team members of MyCrypto and they can decide whether the report makes it to the blacklist.</p>
                <h2>Why was this database created?</h2>
                <p>The database was created in 2017 as https://etherscamdb.info when trying to find a solution to the ethereum scams. In 2018, we migrated to https://cryptoscamdb.org in order to indicate our support of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. 
                  Of course grouping all the scams won't make them go away, but it will make identifying them and taking them down easier. It is now being maintained by members of the <a href="https://mycrypto.com">MyCrypto</a> team. </p>
